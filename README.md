# HTR

The purpose of this Repository is to train a neural net for handwritten text recognition (HTR) using TensorFlow 2 and then converting it to TensorFlow Lite. It is the supposed to be used in an Android App.

## Training

For training the IAM dataset is being used. Therefore a directory with the images and one with the descriptions (labels) must be added to the root directory of the repository. They must be named `images` and `descriptions`.
